Partnering with stakeholders such as {% for target in stakeholders %}{{ target }}{% if not loop.last %} and {% endif %}{% endfor %} keeps delivery grounded in real business impact. I have presented roadmaps to {% for audience in presented_to %}{{ audience }}{% if not loop.last %} and {% endif %}{% endfor %}, ensuring everyone understands the "why" behind every iteration. This approach empowers teams like {% for team in teams %}{{ team }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %} to operate with clarity and urgency.
